# Patron Fetcher

Uses [Patreon's API](https://docs.patreon.com) to populate a json file with a list of my favorite patrons. Updates itself hourly.

I use this to display a list of patrons on [Rai Pal](https://raicuparta.com/rai-pal) and maybe other places later.

Deployed to GitHub Pages to avoid aggressive caching when accessing repo files directly: https://raicuparta.github.io/patron-fetcher/patrons.json
